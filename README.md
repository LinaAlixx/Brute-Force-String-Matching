This program implements the Brute Force String Matching algorithm in Java.
It searches for a given pattern within a text by comparing characters sequentially.
If the pattern is found, the program returns the index of its first occurrence;
otherwise, it returns -1.

The implementation demonstrates a fundamental string matching technique
commonly used in introductory algorithm analysis courses.
